Gamma by ORBS v0.5
Gamma is a local ORBS blockchain to empower developers to easily and efficiently deploy, run & test smart contracts. 
Gamma runs an in-memory virtual chain on top of an ORBS blockchain with N nodes on your local machine.
Gamma-cli - the command line interface is deigned to help you to interact with the virtual chain.

Commands supported:

$ gamma-cli start 
  starts a local virtual chain over ORBS blockchain network, running on 3 nodes. 

$ gamma-cli deploy [contract name] [contract file] 
   Compile the smart contract with go v10.0 and deploy it on the personal orbs blockchain on your machine. 
   Example:  
   cd "$GOPATH/src/github.com/orbs-network/orbs-contract-sdk/" gamma-cli deploy Counter ./go/examples/counter/counter.go 

$ gamma-cli run  send [json file] 
  Use send when you want to send a transaction to a smart contract method that may
  change the the contract state. The transaction will be added to the blockchain under consensus.
   Example: gamma-cli run send ./go/examples/counter/jsons/add.json  

$ gamma-cli run call [json file] Use  when you want to access a smart contract method that reads from your state
  variables. In this case, the read is done on a local node, without undergoing consensus. 
  Example: gamma-cli run call ./go/examples/counter/jsons/get.json 

$ gamma-cli genKeys generates a new pair public and private key to sign on the transactions you send or your
  contract sends. The keys are stored on your computer on a file named .orbsKeys
